Portfolio of Alexander Chen

*Technologies and frameworks to use*

¬ Bootstrap or Skeleton.css or toast for their intuitive, mobile first grid systems
¬jekyll X Siteleaf (Content management system) 
  ¬ I need a CMS for Alex's needs because he isn't a coder, so instead of hardcoding content, Alex should be able to type up Case Studies or add projects without fuss or looking at any code.
  
¬ SCSS (Ability to do a lotta cool things together)

¬ Javascript/jQuery where required!
